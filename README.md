# Graphed-data-from-Valorant-Masters-Tokyo-Grand-Finals
For now, it will show different graphs about the grand finals. 
The whole series can be seen here: https://www.youtube.com/live/kjdwGW3mWV0?feature=share. 
Data was gathered here: https://www.vlr.gg/event/1494/champions-tour-2023-masters-tokyo

Things that I may add here in the future:
1. Proper database that handles all data about each player's stats, agent, economy, kda, and kills per round in each map.
2. Proper system that a user can navigate through (though GUI may not be done in the near future).
